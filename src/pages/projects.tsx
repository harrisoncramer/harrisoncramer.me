      This site is built with Gatsby, a React JAM stack framework. It's written
      in Typescript. It's is hosted on AWS, and the infrastructure was
      provisioned with Terraform. Integration and deployments are run through
      CircleCI.

        This application was built to compile congressional hearing information
        from around the web into a single database. These websites are poorly
        designed and it was often difficult for journalists to get the latest
        information about various congressional hearings quickly and accurately.
        This application solved that issue by making a single, searchable
        database of information that was updated with committee hearing
        information every thirty minutes by scraping these websites. It was used
        by reporters on Capitol Hill, particularly at my former employer
        National Journal.

        This cooking blog features the latest and greatest recipes from my
        partner, Masami, who is an amazing cook. It's built using a Golang-based
        static site generator called Hugo. The site lives on AWS infrastructure
        provisioned by Terraformâ€”just like this site does.
