        My name is Harrison and I'm a software engineer and former national
        security reporter. I'm currently in the June cohort of{" "}
        <a href="https://codesmith.io/">Codesmith</a> where I'm studying
        Javascript.

        This is my personal site, where I'll <Link to="/blog">post</Link> about
        what I'm learning, from CI/CD and DevOps, to React and GraphQL.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        My goal is to make the blog a reference for myself, but also helpful for
        others who are interested in the same technologies. It's intended to be
        fastâ€”not pretty. Built with Gatsby, CircleCI for CI/CD, and Terraform.
