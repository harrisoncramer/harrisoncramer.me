    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Harrison Cramer, and I'm a full-stack developer living in
      Brooklyn. Prior to my career in software, I was a reporter in Washington,
      where I covered foreign policy and the military.
    </p>
    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <p>
      This blog is intended to serve as a resource for other developers using
      Kubernetes, Vue, GraphQL, Golang, and much more. It's built with Gatsby,
      CircleCI for CI/CD, and Terraform.

      I'm also happy to <a href="/contact">connect</a> to talk about software, politics,
      or anything else that's on your mind. I'm always looking for new architectures
      and workflows to write about. Happy coding!
