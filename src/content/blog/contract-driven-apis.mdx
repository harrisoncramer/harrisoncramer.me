One point of friction that often slows down engineering teams is a misunderstanding about API contracts.

Whether it's hotels or online dating, as engineering teams learn more about the domain they're working in, they'll need to adjust parts of the application's data model. Sometimes, this is to correct misconceptions that they originally baked into their APIs. Other times, it's to add new areas of the domain to that they haven't encountered before.

Bit by bit, the team's original mental model of the domain will shift, especially as APIs are deprecated or become bloated with old data.
 
When this happens, having a shared API contract across the engineering team is very valuable. 

As requirements change and the application grows, the contract serves as a guidepost for engineers on both sides of the stack.

This blog outlines three possible approaches to enforcing and sharing a schema in order to enforce consistency in API design.

## OpenAPI and Code Generation

## TRPC

## JSON Schema
