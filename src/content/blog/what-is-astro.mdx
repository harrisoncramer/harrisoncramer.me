Astro is a frontend framework for static site generation. It makes the process of building sites with HTML, CSS, and where necessary, Javascript, a lot easier.

The framework ships _zero_ Javascript by default. This means that sites are faster to load.

## Project Overview
## Astro Files (contact.astro)
## Build System (astro.config.js, vite)
## Using other Frameworks (Layout.astro and Header.tsx)
## "Islands" aka Partial Hydration (dist folder)
## Content Collections (typing)
## Markdown and MDX (and embedding components)
## Contentful (masamicooks)
## Rough Edges
